Car Acceleration Estimator â€“ Android App (Bachelorâ€™s Thesis Project)
This app estimates a carâ€™s straight-line acceleration based on user-defined technical data such as weight, power, gearing, and tire dimensions. It was developed as my bachelorâ€™s thesis and awarded 2nd place at the universityâ€™s Scientific Communications Session.
ðŸ”§ Key Features:

    Real-world accuracy â€“ Calculates acceleration times with a focus on realism using physics-based formulas and precise input data.

    Custom input â€“ Users can enter detailed vehicle parameters like gear ratios, final drive, tire size, redline RPM, and more.

    Graph-based output â€“ Displays speed vs. time graphs to visualize performance across different gears.

    Unit converters â€“ Built-in tools to convert speed, torque, weight, etc., making the app accessible regardless of measurement system.

    Error handling â€“ Alerts for invalid or missing data to ensure reliable results.

    Profile saving â€“ Allows users to save and load multiple vehicle setups for comparison.
